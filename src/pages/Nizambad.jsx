            In an inspiring move towards sustainable agriculture, the District
            Collector of Nizamabad, Ms. Priya Reddy, has allocated special funds
            to a local agri-tech startup, AgriFlow Innovations, to implement a
            groundbreaking paddy drip irrigation project. This initiative aims
            to revolutionize paddy cultivation in the region by onboarding 200
            farmers across 500 acres, in collaboration with Mahindra Irrigation
            Systems. The project is set to enhance water efficiency, increase
            yields, and improve the livelihoods of farmers in the district.
          </p>
          <p>Project Overview</p>
          <p>
            AgriFlow Innovations, founded by Rahul Varma, is a dynamic startup
